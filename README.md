Sales Dataset Analysis and Cleaning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a cleaned dataset derived from the original sales dataset. The purpose of this project is to analyze, clean, and prepare the dataset for further use in data analysis or machine learning tasks.

Contents
salesdataset.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the step-by-step process of loading, cleaning, and saving the dataset.
cleaned_train.csv: The cleaned version of the original dataset, ready for analysis.
Steps Performed
Loading the Dataset:

The dataset was loaded from the file train.csv using the pandas library.
Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing values were dropped to ensure data consistency.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows were identified and removed to avoid redundancy.
Cleaning the Postal Code Column:
Ensured all postal codes were numeric.
Invalid postal codes were replaced with NaN and subsequently removed.
Converted postal codes to integers for consistency.
Saving the Cleaned Dataset:

The cleaned dataset was saved as cleaned_train.csv for further use.
Verification:

Verified the cleaned dataset by checking for missing values, duplicates, and ensuring the postal code column was properly formatted.
How to Use
Clone this repository:
Open the salesdataset.ipynb notebook to view the cleaning process.
Use the cleaned_train.csv file for your analysis or machine learning tasks.
Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for data processing.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and cleaning.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment used for documenting and running the code.
Future Work
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset.
Use the cleaned dataset for predictive modeling or visualization.# sales_cleaneddata
